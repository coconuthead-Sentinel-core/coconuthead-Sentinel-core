# Joke Branch – Cognitive Reset Zone

This branch exists as a light, playful space inside the Sentinel Core project.
It’s used to:
- Reduce stress during long work shifts
- Practice branching and Git workflow skills
- Store small jokes, humor routines, and reset scripts
- Keep Coconut Head in the blue zone (calm, grounded, focused)

## Why This Branch Exists
Neurodivergent users benefit from:
- Simple decisions
- Short text
- Humor resets
- Low-pressure environments

This branch provides all four.

## Current Joke Protocols
1. Theseus shows up barefoot telling stories about stamps and labyrinths.
2. The README has to be read twice because he wrote the same line twice.
3. The turtles outside remind everyone to breathe slowly.

## Moral of the Branch
“Even serious engineers need a porch break.”
