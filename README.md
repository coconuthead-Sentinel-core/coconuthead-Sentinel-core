**AI that thinks like neurodivergent minds actually work**

An enterprise-grade cognitive architecture that processes information using patterns from ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and other cognitive styles - making AI systems accessible to diverse thinkers instead of forcing conformity.

## 🎯 What It Does

Traditional AI assumes everyone thinks the same way. This framework includes specialized processing modes for:

- **ADHD:** Rapid context-switching and dynamic bursts
- **Autism:** Precision pattern recognition and detail focus  
- **Dyslexia:** Multi-dimensional symbol interpretation
- **Dyscalculia:** Alternative mathematical reasoning

**The Result:** AI systems that adapt to how YOU think, not the other way around.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Current estimate: 15-20% of the population is neurodivergent. Most AI tools ignore this entirely, creating accessibility barriers. This framework proves AI can be built inclusively from the ground up.

**Potential Applications:** 
- Accessible knowledge management systems
- Cognitive-diversity-aware AI assistants  
- Enterprise tools for diverse teams
- Research into computational models of different thinking styles

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Architecture:** Object-oriented with dataclasses and type hints
- **Key Features:** Three-zone memory system, symbolic processing, real-time performance monitoring
- **Code Quality:** 1000+ lines, fully typed, production-ready

## 📦 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/coconuthead-Sentinel-core/Sentinel-of-sentinel-s-Forge.git
cd Sentinel-of-sentinel-s-Forge

# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
python quantum_nexus_forge_v5_2_enhanced.py
```

## ✨ Core Features

### Three-Zone Memory System
- **🟢 Active Processing:** High-entropy real-time data (>0.7 entropy)
- **🟡 Pattern Emergence:** Mid-entropy pattern recognition (0.3-0.7 entropy)
- **🔴 Crystallized Storage:** Low-entropy stable memory (<0.3 entropy)

### Neurodivergent Processing Lenses
- Autism precision patterns
- ADHD dynamic bursts
- Dyslexia symbol restructuring
- Dyscalculia alternative logic
- Neurotypical baseline (for comparison)

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Symbolic Stream Processing:** Interpret emoji sequences as cognitive operations
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time metrics and system health tracking
- **Spatial Cognition:** 3D coordinate system with cognitive elevation
- **Geometric Primitives:** Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Dodecahedron, Icosahedron
